# Project Proposal

Author: Cindy Liang

## Project Title

PersistNotes

## What and Why?

I propose to design and develop a unique notes apps called PersistNotes that is specially designed to help users organize their thoughts and feelings while reinforcing their learning and reflection process. A modern problem that many people face and something we aim to solve is the challenge of retaining and internalizing information we encounter daily. Often times, we overlook/ignore our feelings or we jot down thoughts but fail to revisit and process them entirely and effectively. PersistNotes will address this issue by providing a structured platform for capturing, organizing, and reviewing thoughts like digital flashcards.

## For whom?

PersistNotes will cater to a diverse audience, including:

1. Students: For academic note-taking and review, helping them better understand and retain their academic material in a structured way.
2. Professionals in any industry: To organize ideas, insights, and lessons learned during work or conferences. This will also enhance problem-solving abilities.
3. Personal Growth Individuals: Enthusiasts looking to reflect on their daily experiences, insights, and personal development journey.

## How?

PersistNotes will have these following key features:

1. Capture Thoughts: Users can create notes or thoughts and then categorize them by a topic or theme (can be done by adding relevant tags for easy retrieval)
2. Flashcard Review: A flashcard mode that presents users with their notes in a question and answer format. Users need to review and test their knowledge regularly
3. Daily Check-ins: Similar to GitHub's contributions graph, ReflectNotes will track users' daily check-ins, encouraging consistent reflection and note review.
4. Reminders: Users can set reminders to prompt them to review specific notes or flashcards at designated intervals.
5. Search and Organization: Robust search and organization features, including the ability to create notebooks, will help users manage their thoughts effectively.

## Scope

This proposal would be a manageable scope for a group of approximately 4-6 programmers for one semester. We will focus on core features like capturing thoughts, flashcard review, and organization.
